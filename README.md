# Bob-Legend-AI-for-Sparki-Arduino
A slightly silly AI/personality for the Sparki Arduino robot.

This code is designed to be copy-pasted into SparkiDuino. Without SparkiDuino installed this can't do anything.
If you already have SparkiDuino installed, GREAT! Just start-up SparkiDuino and copy BOB_Legend_AI.h into the IDE, plug in a sparki and upload the code to him.

BOB_Legend is a fully autonomous AI/personality
  He will avoid obstacles and edges
  He will stop to investigate objects
  Clap his "hands"(VERY slowly)
  Sing the "Balad of BOB Legend" Thanks to Ben Robinson for writing the "Balad of BOB Legend"
  Dance a little akward robot dance
  And probably some things I forgot about!
